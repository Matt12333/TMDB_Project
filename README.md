<h2>Project Overview</h2>

My first solo project within Digital Futures, where I was tasked to find two key insights and two movies from the dataset that were particularly interesting. It was a challenging dataset that required a lot of cleaning and I was held to a two day deadline before presenting the project.  

The two key insights I uncovered in the data were:  
1) The importance of the clean data and how it effects this dataset
2) The profitability of the movie industry over time and per season of the year
