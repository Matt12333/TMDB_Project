<h2>Project Overview</h2>

This is my first solo project within Digital Futures, where I was tasked to find two key insights from the dataset. It was a challenging dataset that required a lot of cleaning.  

The two key insights I uncovered in the data were:  
1) The importance of the clean data and how it effects this dataset
2) The profitability of the movie industry over time and per season of the year
